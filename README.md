Module 1 Assignment Lab: CSV to JSON Converter

## Comments
The idea that I got from the initial videos was that one of the key points of using node.js was the extensive library available.
So having that in mind, I've solved this chalenge as simple as possible using the suggested library "csvtojson".

It reads the input file "customer-data.csv"
and generates the output file "customer-data.json"

The only "trouble" I've got was to read the documentation and understand how to use the ''csvtojson'' module which is something that we need to get used to search for some module, to read documentation and learn how to use it.
